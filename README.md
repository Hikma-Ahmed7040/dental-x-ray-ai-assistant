# ðŸ¦· Dental X-ray AI Assistant

This project uses deep learning to detect dental caries (cavities) in periapical dental X-ray images.

##  Objective
To assist dentists by automatically identifying signs of tooth decay using computer vision and provide visual evidence via Grad-CAM.

##  Features
- Object detection with YOLOv8
- Real-time predictions on dental X-rays
- Visual explanations (Grad-CAM)
- Streamlit interface for easy use
